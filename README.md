# HallenprojektStatus For OSX

Super alpha status bar app for http://www.hallenprojekt.de

This is my first cocoa app, which means it is hackish and its development involved a lot of trial and error. Help is appreciated.

## TODOS

* Create disk image
* Log out
* Add unit tests
* Make requests asynchronous
* Reconnect to server if credentials were invalid
* Make the application background only. I couldn't figure out how to get it working
  with the preference window.
* User preference for favorite locations
* Use WIFI SSID and/or core location to list the closest places first
* Automate release process (create disk image, push it to download server)
* Integrate sparkle to update the application automatically
* Create proper http post requests with content type set to 'application/json'
