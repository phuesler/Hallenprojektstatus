# HallenprojektStatus For OSX

Super alpha status bar app for http://www.hallenprojekt.de currently running with a local installation only until a new version of hallenprojekt is deployed,
which should be very very soon.

This is my first cocoa app, which means it is hackish and its development involved a lot of trial and error. Help is appreciated.

## TODOS

* Make requests asynchronous
* Reconnect to server if credentials were invalid
* Make the application background only. A couldn't figure out how to get it working
  with the preference window.
